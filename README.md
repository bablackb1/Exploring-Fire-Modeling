# Exploring Fire Modeling – PDE Final Project

This repository contains a 1D traveling wave model of fire propagation, developed for a course in Partial Differential Equations.

## 🔥 Project Overview

The model simulates heat and flame spread using reaction-advection-diffusion principles. It incorporates analytical and numerical techniques, including finite difference methods and wavefront tracking.

## 🧪 Tools Used

- MATLAB (A sampling of the code-based simulation I wrote)
- Overleaf/LaTeX (for report and figures)
- JPG images (for visual reference and model validation)

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `matlab-code/`: Source code for simulation and figure generation
- `.jpg` files: Visual reference material for fire dynamics
- `report/`: Final paper summarizing methods, results, and analysis *(upload PDF here)*

## 📌 Citation

If using this model or figures, please credit the author and course.
