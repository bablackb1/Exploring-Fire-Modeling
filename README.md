This Repository was created for my 1st semester undergraduate Partial Differential Equations class at Cal Poly Pomona in Spring 2025.
We were assigned to select a final project where we would create and present information on a something of interest related to PDEs.
Our region had recently experienced the tragedy of 2 large wildfires which had so adversely affected many families.  I decided to look 
the use of PDEs in the modeling of wildfire behavior.
What follows in the Overleaf based Latex including several images which were generated using MATLAB.
The Overleaf project is all uploaded.
Overtime I will be adding MATLAB code that generated that visuals.
