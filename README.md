# Exploring Fire Modeling – PDE Final Project

This repository contains a 1D traveling wave model of fire propagation, developed for a course in Partial Differential Equations.

## 🔥 Project Overview

We simulate the spread of a traveling wave (fire front) using numerical methods. The model incorporates heat diffusion, a reaction term for combustion, and optionally advection to simulate wind-driven behavior.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `/paper/` — LaTeX source, compiled PDF, and all figures used in the report
- `/matlab-code/` — Sampling of some of the MATLAB scripts used to simulate and visualize the fire model

## 🛠 Tools & Methods

- MATLAB (numerical simulation, plotting)
- Finite difference methods (explicit and semi-implicit schemes)
- Traveling wave analysis
- Overleaf (for report preparation)
